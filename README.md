# AWS Cloud Basics

This repository contains my personal notes while learning AWS Cloud as beginner.
**AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials** as a complete beginner.

## Learning Goal
To build a strong foundation in cloud computing and AWS services.

---

## Module 1 - Cloud Fundamentals 

### Topics Covered
- Client-Server Model
- Coffee Shop Analogy
- Why AWS uses the Client-Server Architecture
- Pay-as-you-go Pricing Model
- On-Demand Resource Provisioning

### Client-Server Model
The client-server model is a computing architecture in which a client requests for services/resources/data, and a server processes those requests and returns the appropriate response over a network.

- **Client**: Device or application that requests a service or resource
- **Server**: System that provides services or resources
- **Network**: Communication medium that carries requests and responses

---

### Coffee Shop Analogy
- Customer -> Client
- Barista and coffe machine -> Server
- Counter / spoken order / order slip -> Network
- Coffee -> Response

---

### Why AWS Uses the Client-Server Architecture
AWS uses the client-server model to support scalability, centralized management, security, high availability, and usage-based billing.

---

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing Model
This is the key concept of AWS. AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model where users are charged only for the resources they use, without upfront hardware costs.

---

### On-Demand Resource Provisioning
AWS allows users to provision (add) and de-provision (remove) computing resources based on their requirements.

- Resources can be launched when needed
- Unused resources can be stopped or terminated
- This provides flexibility and cost efficiency
- Users pay only for active resources

This on-demand model helps AWS scale resouces quickly according to user needs.

## Module 2 - What is Cloud Computing

### Topics Covered 
- Definition of Cloud Computing
- On-Demand Resource Provisioning
- IT Reosurces in the Cloud
- Internet-Based Access to Cloud Services
- Pay-As-You-Go Pricing Model

### What is CLoud Computing?
_AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials_

## Background: How AWS Started
In the early 2000s, Amazon.com was primarily an e-commerce platform. As customer demand increased, Amazon's IT team had to continuously upgrade servers, storage, and computing reosurces.

To handle this efficiently, Amazon developed standardized and scalable internal systems. Later, Amazon realized these solutions could help other companies facing similar challenges. This idea led to the creation of **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, which allows businesses to rent computing resources instead of investing in physial hardware.

### Key Milestones
- **2004** - Launch of Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
- **2006** - Launch of Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Over time, AWS expanded into databases, networking, analytics, and more
- Today, AWS supports millions of customers worldwide

## Definiton of Cloud Computing
**Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet wiht pay-as-you-go pricing.

---

## Key Concepts of Cloud Computing

### 1. On-Demand Resources 
Cloud computing allows users to provision resources when needed and release them when they are no longer required.

**Example:**
- Add storage when needed
- Delete resources and stop paying immediately

 ---
### 2. IT Resources 
Cloud computing provides access to various IT resources such as: 
- Compute (servers)
- Storage
-  Databases
-  Networking
-  Analytics

These resources are hosted in AWS-managed data centers.

---

### 4. Internet-Based Access
Cloud resources are accessed through the internet. 

This enables users to: 
- Manage infrastructure from anywhere
- Access AWS services using a web browser
- Work remotely with just an internet connection

 ---
 
 ### 5. Pay-As-You-Go Pricing
AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model. 

**Features:** 
- No upfront hardware investment
- No long-term contracts
- Pay only for the resources used
- Deprovision resources anytime to stop billing

---

## Key Takeways
- AWS started as an internal solution for Amazon
- Cloud Computing delivers IT resources on demand
- Services are accessible over the internet
- Users pay only for what they use
