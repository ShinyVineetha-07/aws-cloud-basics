## Module 1 - Cloud Fundamentals 

### Client-Server Model
The client-server model is a computing architecture in which a client requests for services/resources/data, and a server processes those requests and returns the appropriate response over a network.

- **Client**: Device or application that requests a service or resource
- **Server**: System that provides services or resources
- **Network**: Communication medium that carries requests and responses

### Coffee Shop Analogy
- Customer -> Client
- Barista and coffe machine -> Server
- Counter / spoken order / order slip -> Network
- Coffee -> Response

### Why AWS Uses the Client-Server Model
AWS uses the client-server model to support scalability, centralized management, security, high availability, and usage-based billing.

---

### Pay-As-You-Go Pricing Model
This is the key concept of AWS. AWS follows a pay-as-you-go pricing model where users are charged only for the resources they use, without upfront hardware costs.

---

### On-Demand Resource Provisioning
AWS allows users to provision (add) and de-provision (remove) computing resources based on their requirements.

- Resources can be launched when needed
- Unused resources can be stopped or terminated
- This provides flexibility and cost efficiency
- Users pay only for active resources

This on-demand model helps AWS scale resouces quickly according to user needs.
